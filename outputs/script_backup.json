      "description": "An ancient, ethereal temple, carved from swirling nebulae and solidified stardust, stands precariously on a forgotten cosmic peak, its spires piercing the interstellar void. Inside, the Venerable Council of the Gods, a dozen figures radiating diverse cosmic energies – some like molten suns, others like ancient glaciers, and some shimmering with the light of nascent stars – are gathered in a circle of uneasy peace. SILAS, the enigmatic God of Innovation and Change, with eyes that burn like freshly kindled stars, steps forward from their hallowed circle, his shadow unnaturally long and distorted against the shimmering, crystalline floor. With a bold, defiant roar that tears through the sacred silence and echoes into the boundless cosmos, he raises the 'Scepter of Celestial Harmony,' an artifact meant to bind their eternal oaths, and shatters it against the temple's central altar. A cataclysmic shockwave of iridescent dust, raw cosmic energy, and agonizing sound rips through the chamber, sending splintered light across the faces of the other deities, their expressions morphing from serene wisdom and ancestral calm to righteous fury, profound sorrow, and existential dread, as the very fabric of their shared dominion shudders violently, portending an irreversible rupture of cosmic order.",

A dozen diverse gods, radiating unique cosmic energies (molten suns, ancient glaciers), are recoiling in shock and fury. In the foreground, SILAS, a god with eyes like nascent stars, holds a shattered, glowing ornate scepter, iridescent dust and raw energy exploding from the altar where he just struck it. The temple's shimmering floor cracks, nebulae swirl violently outside vast cosmic windows. Cinematic, high fantasy, dramatic lighting, epic scale.",

      "description": "The cosmic void itself transforms into a sprawling, apocalyptic canvas for unimaginable destruction, a maelstrom of divine power. Gigantic celestial beings, ethereal manifestations of the warring gods' raw power, clash violently amidst asteroid fields that vaporize into superheated plasma on impact, their forms shifting like living constellations. Entire planets, once cradles of life, shatter like delicate glass marbles as divine energy blasts rip through the cosmos – crimson lightning from ZEPHYR, the tempestuous God of Storms, colliding with blinding emerald nova blasts from AURELIUS, the radiant God of Light, in explosions that dwarf galaxies. Ancient, serpentine dragons made of pure starlight entwine with grotesque, mountain-sized titans born of cosmic dust and shadow, their earth-shaking roars reverberating across light-years and rattling distant, unsuspecting suns. Below this grand, devastating spectacle, on a fractured, burning moon scarred by the initial attacks, smaller, more agile deities engage in brutal, close-quarters combat, their legendary weapons — swords forged from black holes, shields shimmering with nascent galaxies — clashing with deafening, world-splitting cracks that echo across the emptiness of space. The conflict is a true maelstrom of raw, untamed power, a dance of destruction that reshapes galaxies, with meteors raining down like bitter, fiery tears from a dying universe, each impact a testament to the gods' boundless wrath.",

      "description": "A vast, desolate cosmic plain stretches into an oppressive, silent infinity, a graveyard of creation. It is littered with the cold, silent husks of shattered planets, their once vibrant cores now just exposed, jagged rock; dormant celestial weapons, their power long extinguished; and the colossal, petrified remains of forgotten deities, twisted into grotesque, silent monuments of a bygone era. The once vibrant nebulae that painted the cosmic tapestry are now just cold, grey dust clouds, slowly drifting like funerary shrouds through the lifeless expanse. ELARA, the Goddess of Order, now clad in battle-worn armor, its once pristine silver tarnished and scored, walks slowly through this graveyard of stars, her divine aura dimmed, flickering like a dying ember against the overwhelming emptiness. Her face is etched with profound weariness, an ancient grief that transcends millennia, and an unimaginable loss. She pauses beside a colossal, shattered crystalline throne, once the majestic seat of Silas, now just jagged ruins reflecting the spectral light of distant, dying stars. A single tear, shimmering with the raw energy of a cosmic nebula, rolls down her cheek, reflecting the desolate, irreparable landscape. The silence is absolute, heavy, and eternal, broken only by the faint, distant hum of a new, unstable star struggling valiantly to ignite, a fragile, desperate spark of hope in the overwhelming, profound emptiness. The war is truly over, but the cost is immeasurable, leaving an eternal, gaping wound across the very fabric of creation.",
